Programming Language: C++
OS: Linux (Ubunut 19.04) & Mac OS
Compile Instructions: Program was tested with two compile options 1) Clion with this option the run command was not able to 
                      handle the arguments being passed in to you must locate the compiled executable and run it from command line.
                      the other option is to com the code with gcc and cmake this was done with Visual Studio code and the cmake plugin 
                      from Microsoft called "CMake Tools" before installing the extension please make sure you have cmake instlled
                      (on linux this is as simple as sudo apt install cmake) once you have both you should be able to hit f7 in vs code
                      and it will compile. The first time this is done it will need to configure.
